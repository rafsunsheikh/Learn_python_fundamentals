# Your code will work fine. But it can be solved more easily.
# Here is the code that I have written for the same problem:


print("In this program we will convert kgs to pounds")
num1 = input("Enter the weight in kgs: ")
converter = 2.20462
pounds = float(num1) * converter
print("The weight in pounds is: ", pounds, "lbs")
