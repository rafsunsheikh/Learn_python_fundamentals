# The code will work fine. But it can be solved more easily.
# Here is the code that I have written for the same problem:

print("In this program we will convert pounds to kgs")
num1 = input("Enter the weight in pounds: ")
converter = 0.453592 
kgs = float(num1) * converter
print("The weight in kgs is: ", kgs, "kgs")
